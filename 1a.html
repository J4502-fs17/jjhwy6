    <h1>About the Study</h1>

    <p>Drawing from the literature on digital media and social movements as well as race and class politics, this study analyzes the role media played in the 2014 and 2015 Ferguson Movement. Contrary to current conversations about #Ferguson, this article elevates the voices of local activists who organized from the streets of St. Louis, Missouri through an analysis of 20 unstructured interviews with community activist. It also places these interviews within the context of Twitter discourse. Employing a mixed-methods approach, the authors illustrate how local activists re-positioned themselves in ways not always captured via social media (particularly during the movementâ€™s early stages). Such findings illustrate a more complex movement that is locally-specific, anti-racist and anti-neoliberal; a complexity under-theorized within media activism literature.

    <p>The purpose of this project is to tell the story or stories of the Ferguson Movement from the perspectives of those whose lived experiences are embedded within the history of St. Louis, Missouri. In doing so, their project re-frames the larger national narrative about activism and the Black Lives Matter movement. It tells a more specific and locally-based narrative of the movement.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

    <p>The current study is informed by a larger exploratory sequential mixed method study (Creswell, 2014) of the St. Louis activist community. The larger study consisted of four types data: (1) Geocoded U.S. Census demographics, (2) digital media, (3) archival and (4) community activist interviews. Through the collection of both forms of empirical data (quantitative and qualitative), the sequential nature of the research design, data collection and analysis began with the collection of interviews with community activists, which then led to the collection of the geocoded census data. The archival and digital media data were collected concurrently while interviews were being conducted. This current study primarily draws from the qualitative data, specifically interviews with community activists and digital media datasets.
